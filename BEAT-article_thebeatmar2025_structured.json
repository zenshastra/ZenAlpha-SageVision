Not to be construed as an investment or research recommendation.\nTOP IDEAS\nEurope: The Underdog\nTariffs, reconstruction and reindustrialization. Europe is \nthe next regional target for tariffs, and although this is well-\nadvertised, the announcement may still roil markets. We \nwould view this as a buying opportunity. While European \nequities are the consensus underweight heading into 2025, \nthey are the best performing DM year-to-date. As PMIs (an \nindication of the health of manufacturing) recover from a \nmulti-year trough below 50, Europe is poised to recover. A \nceasefire between Russia and Ukraine would provide further \nsupport. After all, doesn't everyone like the underdog!\nTo Be or Not To Be Inflationary\nThat is the question. Whether tariffs are inflationary or not \nis hotly debated. On the one hand, they may not be because \nwithout a monetary offset the impact is just a one-off rise in \nprices subject to substitution effects to lower priced goods. \nOn the other, it may be because it disrupts supply chains and \ncreates inefficiencies that put sustained upward pressure on \nprices. What does the market think? It seems to have sided \nwith mildly-inflationary, as inflation breakevens have risen. \nThis puts duration at risk.\nLet\u2019s Get Fiscal: Tariffs, Taxes, Budget\nIt\u2019s part of the plan. One of President Trump\u2019s main goals \nthis year is to pass a pro-growth budget plan, accomplished \nby creating easier fiscal policy spurred by tax relief, while \nsimultaneously controlling the deficit. As we saw in February, \ntariffs were the first step to create the revenue needed to \noffset his plan to lower taxes. Starting in March, the linkage \nbetween the two will become part of the narrative, where we \nwill be watchful of which sectors stand to benefit most.\nGrowth: Taking the Easy Way Out\nDespite the noise, growth is still good. Global economic \ngrowth is still pointing toward expansion. Other than Japan, \nglobal central bank policies remain easy or at least are not \ntightening. This provides a tailwind to earnings and margins \nand is supportive of asset prices - let's not lose sight of this \nas it provides the signal through the noise. We think this \nsupports a broadening of markets and our cyclical recovery \ntheme. \n",

Not to be construed as an investment or research recommendation.\nTOP IDEAS\nAdding to Equities \nFinding value and diversification in Europe. It is counter the \nconsensus to add to European equity exposure, but this is what we \nare doing regardless. Why? A number of reasons: Recovering global \nPMIs, a low bar for earnings expected to surprise to the upside, \nGerman elections, pro-growth polices gaining favor and diversification \nall benefit European equities as an attractive large-cap value play. \nOne of our themes calls for a broadening of the markets that favors \ncyclicals and value, which we are adding exposure to in both the U.S. \nand Europe.\nAdd Exposure to European Construction\nImproving fundamentals with positive optionality. After a \nchallenging few years, the European Construction & Construction \nMaterials sector looks poised for a rebound, as the tailwind from rate \ncuts works its way into construction activity. Additionally, news of a \nceasefire in Ukraine and related reconstruction efforts could provide a \nfurther boost to EPS, providing positive optionality to the trade. With \ncheap valuation and relative insulation from tariff risks, we view this as \nan attractive opportunity.\nAre Bonds Riskier than Stocks?\nDuration. We have shifted portfolios to a modest underweight in \nduration, but we may continue to reduce. This is because 1) we hold a \nview that the yield curve may continue to steepen and 2) pro-growth \nfiscal policy is unfolding alongside tariffs, tilting the scales towards \nslightly higher inflation. As such, we prefer adding exposure to equities \nat the expense of duration-sensitive bonds. However, we remain \noverweight less duration-sensitive and higher-yielding credit.\nA Turning Point for Real Estate\nPricing stabilizing amid improving fundamentals. Real estate has \nbeen experiencing a repricing over the last few years in response to \nhigher interest rates, cyclical oversupply and, in certain sectors, \nsecular demand destruction. However, the long-term operating outlook \nis markedly improving, with future supply materially decreasing and \nthe demand destruction underway in certain sectors stabilizing. Entry \npricing is meaningfully lower, providing a margin of safety and an \ninteresting access point to these improving fundamentals. \n",

Note: Over/underweight in private markets refers to decisions regarding the flow of new investments, not the stock of existing investments.\nAlternative Assets\nCommentary\nPrivate Markets\nPrivate Equity\nWe expect investor cash flows to recover due to increasing market activity, and asset pricing to offer an attractive entry point. While a key discipline in private equity investing is to limit \nexposure to exogenous risks, the directional clarity associated with the change of government in the U.S. is expected to expand deal-making activity, but likely to have an uneven impact on \nthe growth opportunities and risks within each sector. The prospect of deregulation will potentially lead to increased opportunities in Financials and Healthcare and reduced anti-trust \nintervention could spark additional M&A more broadly. However, growth policies have the potential to add to inflation, so we continue to focus on middle-market strategies that rely less on \nleverage and are well-placed to deliver asset management initiatives to drive margin expansion and real earnings growth.\nPrivate Real \nAssets\nCommercial real estate is working through its debt maturity wall and pockets of elevated supply, leading to increased transaction volumes at more attractive entry valuations. These reset \nvaluations and retreat of bank lending have created interesting opportunities for commercial real estate lenders. At the same time, fundamentals are constructive, as debt liquidity improves \nand the future supply in key sectors is materially lower, setting up an attractive opportunity for commercial real estate equity as well - particularly in secularly growing sectors including \nindustrial, residential and net lease. \nPrivate infrastructure continues to participate in the investable opportunities relating to the mega trends of digitization and power generation. These themes converge where data services \nrequire power, and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is highlighting the fact that the current power mix is insufficient in terms of volume, density and reliability. Private investors are playing a \nkey role in supplying this enabling infrastructure with attractive growth prospects. Recently observable policy changes in the U.S. and the Deepseek announcements could threaten \nperformance in projects that are over-extended in their cash flow or valuations, but we believe investments in mature cost-competitive technologies that are under supplied versus demand \ntailwinds will continue to be positioned for strong returns.\nPrivate Credit\nWithin corporate lending, covenant relief cases have increased as debt service has become more burdensome, but demand for products and services is generally healthy which is supporting \nprofitability and debt coverage. Companies in unorthodox or transitional situations are accessing special situations capital that is improving alignment and offering attractive returns for \ninvestors.\nLiquid Alternatives\nHedge Funds\nGiven the current market drivers, we prefer hedge fund specialist portfolio managers who are best positioned to analyze policy impacts on security prices and capture the potential opportunity \nin increased capital markets activity. We stress the need to incorporate highly liquid, responsive, macro convexity strategies within portfolios to capitalize on price volatility should consensus \nviews prove incorrect, stoking periods of broader market volatility. In addition, our highest conviction sub-strategies are fixed income relative value and quantitative long / short equity to take \nadvantage of decreasing correlations at the micro level.\nCommodities\nWe remain neutral on key commodity markets as geopolitical upside risks are balanced by high spare capacity in markets such as crude, limiting upside absent physical disruptions.\n",

Credit \u2013 \nInvestments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject \nto the risk of non-payment of principal and interest.

Interest Rate \u2013 As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to \ndecline..

Maturity \u2013 Longer-term bonds \ntypically are more sensitive to interest rate changes than shorter-term bonds. Preferred Stocks \u2013 When interest \nrates rise, the value of preferred stocks will generally decline. Prepayment - MBS \u2013 Mortgage-backed securities \nare subject to prepayment risk. Prepayment - Bank Loan \u2013 Bank Loans are subject to prepayment risk.

      "text": "The BEAT | March 2025\n58\nRisk Considerations \nDiversification does not eliminate the risk of loss.\nIn general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. \nInvestments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market \nrisks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with \ninvestments in foreign developed countries. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an \nissuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-\nrate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising \ninterest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased \nportfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. \nLonger-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Alternative investments are \nspeculative, involve a high degree of risk, are highly illiquid, typically have higher fees than other \ninvestments, and may engage in the use of leverage, short sales, and derivatives, which may increase \nthe risk of investment loss. These investments are designed for investors who understand and are \nwilling to accept these risks. Performance may be volatile, and an investor could lose all or a substantial \nportion of its investment.\nThere is no guarantee that any investment strategy will work under all market conditions, and each \ninvestor should evaluate their ability to invest for the long-term, especially during periods of downturn in \nthe market. \nA separately managed account may not be appropriate for all investors. Separate accounts \nmanaged according to the Strategy include a number of securities and will not necessarily track \nthe performance of any index.
